    <summary>RSS Ticker loads your Live Bookmarks and scrolls their entries across your screen while you surf.</summary>
    <description>RSS Ticker loads your Live Bookmarks and scrolls their entries across your screen while you surf.  It&#39;s perfect for staying informed without having to actively browse entries in an RSS reader.The ticker can be placed at the bottom of the screen (below the status bar) or at the top of the screen (underneath your bookmarks toolbar).  Nearly all aspects of the ticker&#39;s display are customizable, including the scroll speed, smoothness, and link width.  You can even set a limit for the number of items that appear from each feed.You can decide which of your Live Bookmarks you want scrolled in the ticker by checking or unchecking the box in the bookmark&#39;s properties dialog (right-click on the Live Bookmark in the Bookmarks menu and choose Properties), or by managing all of your feeds in the ticker&#39;s feed manager (in the RSS Ticker options dialog).You can choose to have RSS Ticker shuffle all of the entries from all of the feeds so that you always have a variety of links showing in the ticker, and since RSS Ticker shows the feed&#39;s favicon (favorite&#39;s icon) next to each entry, you&#39;ll know exactly which feed each entry is from.The ticker and the items in the ticker have a context menu, which allows you to open each item in the current tab, a new tab, or a new window, mark an item as read without opening it, mark an entire feed as read, or mark all feeds as read. You can also open items in tabs in a variety of ways.  There is also an option to manually refresh your feeds.  The context menu is customizable, so you can choose to hide the options you don&#39;t want to see.  (Note: Since version 1.7, you can mark an item as read by Ctrl-clicking on it.)You can move the ticker back and forth manually using the scrollwheel on your mouse, so if you just missed something interesting, you can easily reverse the ticker and get to the link you want.By choosing to customize your Firefox toolbar, you can add the RSS Ticker toolbar button. This button can be used to quickly enable or disable the ticker without visiting the options dialog.RSS Ticker reads RSS (2.0, 1.0, 0.9x) and Atom feeds, and the ticker can be disabled and hidden when you&#39;re not using it, unlike many other ticker extensions.  You can also have it hide itself when it&#39;s empty, perfect for saving valuable screen space.=====================================For those who are new to Live Bookmarks or RSS Feeds:There are two ways to add a Live Bookmark in Firefox:1. If the page you are looking at in your browser offers an RSS feed ( http://digg.com/ , for example), there will be a small orange icon on the right side of the address bar.  If you click on that, it will open the &quot;Add Live Bookmark&quot; dialog.2. In the Bookmarks Manager, (found under Bookmarks &gt; Manage Bookmarks), there is an option under the File menu for &quot;New Live Bookmark.&quot;  Here you can put the location of the XML feed in the Location field.After doing either of these steps, restarting Firefox or choosing &quot;Refresh Feeds&quot; from the Ticker&#39;s context menu will show the feed in the ticker.</description>

    <summary>The easy way to download and convert Web videos from hundreds of YouTube-like sites.This works also for audio and picture galleries.</summary>
    <description>DownloadHelper is a tool for web content extraction. Its purpose is to capture video and image files from many sites.Just surf the Web as you are used to, when DownloadHelper detects it can do something for you, the icon gets animated and a menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an itemFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you&#39;ll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with MySpace, Google videos, DailyMotion, Porkolt, iFilm, DreamHost and others.Since version 3.1, you can setup the extension to automatically convert the downloaded movies to your preferred video format.When you are on a page containing links to images or movies, you can download some or all of them at once. Moving the mouse over the items in the menu will highlights the links directly in the page to make sure they are the ones you want to pick up.DownloadHelper also allows you to download files one by one, so that you keep bandwidth to surf for other stuff to download.To modify your preferences, like changing the download directory, right-click on the icon and choose &quot;Preferences&quot;.When you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at http://www.downloadhelper.net/manual.php and a faq at http://www.downloadhelper.net/faq.phpThis does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won&#39;t appear anymore.Support can be obtained from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php</description>

    <summary>Post to Twitter from your address bar.** Winner of Mozilla Mobile Add-ons Challenge! **</summary>
    <description>** Winner of Mozilla Mobile Add-ons Challenge! **TwitterBar allows you to post to Twitter from Firefox&#39;s address bar. A small Twitter icon sits to the right of your address bar; clicking on it will post your tweet, and you can hover your mouse over it to see how many characters you have left.You can also post by typing &quot;--post&quot; at the end of your tweet.  Clicking the Twitter icon when visiting a webpage will send a tweet containing the URL of the webpage you are currently viewing.As of version 2.9, you can post to multiple Twitter accounts.  To post to a specific account, just type --@account_name at the end of your tweet (but before typing --post). e.g., &quot;Tweeting from my personal account. --@jimmy2424 --post&quot;.  (If you have authorized more than one account but don&#39;t specify which one to post to, you&#39;ll be asked to select from a list.) To add a new account, just type --account in the URL bar. You&#39;ll be prompted to sign into Twitter with the new account.You can manage your accounts from the options dialog. Just type --options in the URL bar.</description>
